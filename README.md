#### Description:

 With no help in sight it is up to you to defend your base from the seemingly endless number of enemies attacking you for your resources. Just you, your gun and the hundreds of enemies. How long can you survive?

My CS50 Final Project is an endless first-person shooter created using the game engine Unity and the programming language C#. This project was my first time ever using Unity and C Sharp so it was a daunting task to start but with my knowledge from all the weeks of learning at CS50 I was prepared for learning and applying new programming languages. I spent many hours writing thousands of lines of code and still managed to complete my first game in only 7 days.
